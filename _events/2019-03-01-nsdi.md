#### Held in Boston, MA, USA on March 1, 2019

The P4 Hackathon aims to develop novel, proof-of-concept data plane applications, and to support the open-source community through the development of tools and infrastructure.

We are keen to meet new people, see new faces, and create new collaborations between (and within) academia and industry!

  (with password "p4").
