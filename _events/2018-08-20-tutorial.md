### Virtual Machine

We have created a virtual machine that has all of the software needed to complete the developer day exercises already installed. You can either download a virtual machine image or build it from source. Note that both of these procedures can take around 45 minutes depending on the speed of your network connection.

* To download the virtual machine image
    1. Install VirtualBox  
       [https://virtualbox.org](https://virtualbox.org)
    1. Download virtual machine image  
       [P4 Tutorial 2018-06-01.ova](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1f22-DYlUV33DsR88_MeMb4s7-1NX_ams&export=download)
    1. Import virtual machine into VirtualBox  
       Open VirtualBox, select "File > Import Appliance", and navigate to the downloaded file.
    1. Boot virtual machine  
       Select "P4 Tutorial 2018-06-01", and click "Start". 

* To build the virtual machine from source
    1. Install VirtualBox  
       [https://virtualbox.org](https://virtualbox.org)
    1. Install Vagrant  
       [https://vagrantup.com](https://vagrantup.com)
    1. Clone the tutorial repository  
       `$ git clone https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials`
    1. Navigate to the vm directory  
      `$ cd tutorials/vm/`
    1. Build the virtual machine  
      `$ vagrant up`
    
* Final steps  
  After the machine boots, you should have a graphical desktop with
  all required software pre-installed, logged in as username "p4"
  (with password "p4").
