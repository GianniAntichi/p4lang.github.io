#### P4 Hackathon at [IETF 105](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/105/) in Montreal on July 20-21, 2019.

The [Computing in the Network](https://irtf.org/coinrg) (COIN) IRTF research group will host a P4
Hackathon at [IETF 105](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/105/) in Montreal on July 20 and 21. The goal of the
hackathon is to give the COIN community a way to investigate new
applications in P4 and develop prototypes of potential new
applications. As of now, a lot of P4 development has focused on data centers, but we would like the hackathon to address the DC-edge programming spectrum. 

Topics of interest include industrial applications for fault detection, data filtering in streaming media, autonomous devices at the edge and distributed networking. Participants will be provided with all the tools necessary to create their application.
